    <li>1 Table spoon mustard powder</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons garlic salt</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon pepper (use white pepper if you have it)/li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Fried chicken ingrediants</h2>

   <ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken, cut up (or 8 pieces of your favorite cuts of chicken)</li>
    <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons hot sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup cornstarch </li>
    <li>peanut oil (for frying)</li>
    <li>Flaked salt (for sreving, optional)</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>

   <ol>
    <li><p>Mix in all <b>11 spices and herbs</b> and set them to the side for later</p></li>
    <li><p>add <b>2 cups buttermilk</b> and <b>2 Tablespoons hot sauce</b>, stir until everything is combined.
    Cover with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the fridge for atleast 2 hours, but it's best if you can let it stay overnight</p></li>
    <li><p>In a medium size bowl, whisk together <b>2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornstarch,</b> and <b>the 11 herbs and spices</b>. Set aside</p></li>
    <li>Fill up a deep fryer with <b>penut oil</b> (or neutral frying oil of your choice)
    and preheat to 325F - <i>you may need to turn down the heat to 300F if you notice the skin is getting dark to quickly</i>

    <p>Also, if using a cast iron skillet, please remember it holds heat very well so it is easy for it to get too hot so please monitor closely.<p></li>
    <li><p>Taking the chicken pieces one at a time, let the excess buttermilk drip off. Coat in the flour mixture, make sure the chicken is well coated. 
    Shake off any excess. Set the chicken aside and let it sit for a few minutes until the coating starts to look a little pasty.</p></li>
    <li><p>Carefully add the piece of chicken to the deep fryer and continue with the next piece. Don't add more than three or four pieces at at time. 
    You will need to fry in batches so you do not overcrowd the fryer. Fry until golden brown, turning every few minutes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Chicken is done when golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165Â°F. Depending on the size of the chicken, dark meat can take about 12-14 minutes 
    and white meat takes 8-10 minutes (these are estimates - use a meat thermometer for accurate doneness)</p></li>
    <li><p>When the chicken is done frying, place it on a paper towel lined sheet tray and immediately sprinkle a little flaked salt on top. 
    Continue with the rest of the chicken pieces.</p></li>

   </ol>
