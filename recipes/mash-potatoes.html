    <h2><b>Description</b></h2>

    <p>Good old Southern <i>mashed potatoes</i> are the ultimate comfort 
        foodâ€”<i>creamy, buttery, and made with love</i>. Boiled until perfectly tender, 
        the potatoes are mashed smooth with generous helpings of real butter, a splash of 
        whole milk, and just the right amount of salt and pepper. Sometimes a 
        touch of sour cream or a hint of garlic is added for extra richness, but the heart 
        of this classic dish lies in its <b>simplicity and warmth</b>. Served hot and fluffy, they're 
        a staple at Sunday dinners, holiday feasts, and family gatherings all across the South.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <p><li>3/4 cup milk</li></p>
            <p><li>1/4 cup chicken broth (or enough to cover the potatoes)</li></p>

            <p><li>Scrub the potatoes and if you prefer peeled potatoes peel them now</li></p>
            <p><li>Dice the potatoes so that they are small and close in size (dicing them to similar 
                sizes will help ensure the potatoes cook evenly)</li></p>

            <p><li>Pour mixture over potatoes and mash until desired consistency</li></p>
